            Moka coffee, also known as stovetop espresso, is a rich and robust coffee brewed using a Moka pot. This method
             produces a strong, concentrated coffee similar to espresso but with a slightly different flavor profile. The Moka pot
              consists of three main parts: a bottom chamber for water, a middle funnel-shaped filter for ground coffee, and a top 
              chamber where the brewed coffee collects. When heated on the stove, steam pressure forces the hot water through the 
              coffee grounds, resulting in a bold and aromatic brew. Moka coffee is often enjoyed on its own or used as a base for 
              various coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.

        <ul>
            <li><img src="img/glass-water-solid-full.svg" alt="" class="icon">1 cup of water</li>
            <li><img src="img/spoon-solid-full.svg" alt="" class="icon">2 tablespoons of ground coffee</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fill the bottom chamber of the Moka pot with water up to the safety valve. Use fresh, cold water—filtered if 
                possible—for the best flavor. Carefully pour the water into the lower chamber of the Moka pot, stopping just below 
                the small safety valve located on the side. This valve is a crucial safety feature designed to release pressure if 
                
                it builds up too much, so it should never be submerged. Overfilling can block the valve and affect the brewing process, 
                while underfilling may result in weak coffee. Ensuring the correct water level helps maintain both the safety and the 
                quality of your brew..</strong></li>
            <img src="img/1.png" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li><strong>Place the ground coffee into the filter basket without pressing it down. Spoon the desired amount of finely ground
                 coffee into the metal filter basket of your Moka pot—typically about two tablespoons for a standard size. As you fill it,
                  let the grounds settle naturally without compacting or tamping them. Unlike espresso machines, the Moka pot relies on 
                  steam pressure to push water through the coffee, and tightly packed grounds can obstruct this flow, leading to 
                  over-extraction or uneven brewing. A loose, level fill ensures the water passes through smoothly, extracting rich flavor
                   without bitterness. You can gently level the surface with the back of a spoon, but avoid pressing down.</strong></li>
            <img src="img/2.png" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li>Assemble the Moka pot by screwing the top and bottom chambers together. Once the bottom chamber is filled with water and the 
                filter basket is properly loaded with ground coffee, carefully align the top chamber over the base. Begin to screw the two 
                parts together, turning gently but firmly until they are securely sealed. Make sure the rubber gasket and metal filter inside
                 the top chamber are clean and properly seated—this ensures a tight seal and prevents leaks during brewing.
                  Avoid overtightening, which can damage the threads or make it difficult to unscrew later. A snug fit is enough to allow
                   pressure to build safely and push the water through the coffee grounds into the upper chamber..</li>
            <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li><strong>Place the Moka pot on medium heat. Set your stovetop burner to medium heat and position the assembled Moka pot directly over it. Using medium heat allows the water in the bottom chamber to gradually build pressure and rise through the coffee grounds without scorching them. If the heat is too high, the coffee may brew too quickly, resulting in a burnt or bitter taste. If it's too low, the process may stall or take too long. For gas stoves, ensure the flame doesn't extend beyond the base of the pot to avoid damaging the handle. On electric or induction stoves, center the pot for even heating. This gentle, steady heat is key to achieving a smooth, aromatic brew..</strong></li>
            <img src="img/4.png" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li><strong>Wait for the coffee to brew and fill the top chamber. As the water in the bottom chamber heats up, pressure builds and forces the hot water upward through the coffee grounds and into the top chamber. You’ll begin to hear a gentle bubbling or gurgling sound—this means the brewing process is underway. Resist the urge to open the lid during this stage, as steam and hot liquid could escape. Watch and listen carefully: when the top chamber starts to fill with rich, dark coffee and the bubbling sound turns into a soft hissing or spurting noise, the brewing is nearly complete. This sound signals that most of the water has passed through, and it’s time to remove the pot from the heat to avoid over-extraction or burning the coffee..</strong></li>
            <img src="img/5.jpg" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li><strong>Once you hear a hissing sound, remove the Moka pot from heat. The hissing or gurgling sound signals that the brewing process is nearly complete. It means the last bit of water is being pushed through the coffee grounds and into the top chamber. At this point, promptly remove the Moka pot from the heat to prevent overheating or burning the coffee. Leaving it on the stove too long can cause the coffee to taste bitter or scorched. Carefully grasp the handle—designed to stay cool—and move the pot off the burner. Let it sit for a moment to allow any remaining coffee to finish bubbling up. Your brew is now ready to be served!</Strong></li>
            <img src="img/6.png" alt="" class="ins-img">
            <li><strong>Pour the coffee into a cup and add milk or sugar if desired. Once the brewing process is complete and the coffee has settled in the top chamber, carefully open the lid of the Moka pot. Using the handle—which should remain cool—gently pour the freshly brewed coffee into your favorite cup. The coffee will be rich and concentrated, similar to espresso. At this point, you can enjoy it as is for a bold flavor, or customize it to your taste. Add a splash of warm milk for a creamier texture, or stir in sugar to balance the intensity with a touch of sweetness. Some people even enjoy adding a sprinkle of cinnamon or cocoa powder for an aromatic twist. Sip slowly and savor the deep, robust flavor of your homemade Moka coffee.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Enjoy your Moka coffee! Now that your coffee is brewed and poured, take a moment to savor the aroma rising from your cup. Whether you prefer it bold and black or mellowed with a splash of milk and a touch of sugar, this rich, full-bodied brew is a reward for your care and patience. Find a cozy spot, take a sip, and enjoy the deep, satisfying flavor that only a Moka pot can deliver. It’s more than just coffee—it’s a ritual, a pause in your day, and a little moment of joy.</strong></li>
